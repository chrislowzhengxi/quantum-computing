    "- op = qiskit.quantum_info.Operator(circuit) will create an operator object, and op.data will let you look at the overall matrix for a circuit.\n",
    "- Keep in mind that Qiskit has a different relationship between the drawing and mathematical representation than we have. Specifically, they place the left-most bit at the bottom rather than at the top. You can [**watch this video**](https://youtu.be/Gf7XFFKS9jE) for more information. This has several implications.\n",
    "- If you look at a circuit the way we do, then the state vector ends up being stored as \\[00, 10, 01, 11\\] rather than \\[00, 01, 10, 11\\] (where the qubit on top is still the left-most qubit).\n",
    "- In reality, though, Qiskit also considers the qubit order to be swapped (little endian), where the top qubit is the least significant (right-most) bit. That is for qubits from top to bottom q0, q1, q2, the bitstring is q2, q1, q0. So the state vector is still \\[00, 01, 10, 11\\] from this perspective. We can see this in the CX gate.\n",
