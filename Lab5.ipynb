    "# Lab 5: Simulating an N-qubit system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction: Building on Single Qubit Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, you built a `SingleQubitSystem` class that simulated quantum states and operations on a single qubit. You implemented core methods to initialize quantum states, inspect them (measuring probabilities), and apply quantum gates like Hadamard and Pauli-Z. This week, we're taking a significant step forward: you'll generalize that single-qubit simulator to handle an **arbitrary number of qubits**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous assignment, you were provided with substantial skeleton code that outlined the class structure, method signatures, and helper functions. This scaffolding allowed you to focus on understanding the quantum mechanics and implementing the core logic. **In this assignment, you will be expected to do everything yourself.** You'll implement all required methods, and write comprehensive tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The jump from single-qubit to N-qubit systems requires a fundamental shift in how you think about quantum state representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `SingleQubitSystem`, you could hardcode quantum gate matrices—a 2×2 matrix for single-qubit gates is simple and manageable. Now, with N qubits, gate matrices scale exponentially: an operation on an N-qubit system requires a 2^N × 2^N matrix. Rather than hardcoding these, you'll need to **programmatically construct** gate matrices and tensor products that generalize to any number of qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond extending existing operations, in this lab you will also implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-qubit gates**: You'll implement the SWAP and the CNOT gates.\n",
    "- **Quantum oracles**: You'll implement two oracles—the **BernVaz oracle** and the **Archimedes oracle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Task 0: Swapping bits\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into quantum mechanics, let's build intuition for how **SWAP** operations work at the bit level. Understanding classical bit swapping will help you reason about the quantum SWAP gate you'll implement later.\n",

If bit swapping changes the binary representation, how does that change *which* element of the state vector you're modifying?\n",

If you wanted to swap qubits 0 and 1, how would the indices of your state vector elements need to be rearranged? Can you see a pattern that would work for *any* pair of qubits in an N-qubit system?\n",
