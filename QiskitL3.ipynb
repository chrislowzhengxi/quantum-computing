        "# Introduction\n",
        "These labs will be an introduction to the Qiskit Framework, which is a Python package, developed by IBM, for construction, testing, optimizing, simulating and running quantum circuits on real quantum computers!\n",
        "\n",
        "Qiskit works by declaratively building up quantum circuits by creating Quantum and Classical Registers, creating a circuit object and then adding gates to the circuit that act on specific qubits.\n",
        "# This Lab\n",
        "In this particular lab assignment, these exercises build up to more complex circuits, and you will be creating circuits based on a given input and a given output.\n",
        "\n",
        "When considering the state of a circuit in this lab, consider the \"top\" qubit, qubit 0 in a bitstring representing the state of the circuit. The following circuit numbering is a representation of where each qubit should be considered to be in the bitstring.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Some helpful programming hints\n",
        "\n",
        "- The line `circuit.draw()`, where `circuit` is your Qiskit circuit, will draw out the circuit so you can visualize it.\n",
        "- `op = qiskit.quantum_info.Operator(circuit)` will create an operator object, and `op.data` will let you look at the overall matrix for a circuit.\n",
        "- Keep in mind that Qiskit has a different relationship between the drawing and mathematical representation than we have. Specifically, they place the left-most bit at the bottom rather than at the top. You can [**watch this video**](https://youtu.be/Gf7XFFKS9jE) for more information. This has several implications.\n",
        "- If you look at a circuit the way we do, then the state vector ends up being stored as `[00, 10, 01, 11]` rather than `[00, 01, 10, 11]` (where the qubit on top is still the left-most qubit).\n",
        "- In reality, though, Qiskit also considers the qubit order to be swapped (little endian), where the top qubit is the least significant (right-most) bit. That is for qubits from top to bottom `q0`, `q1`, `q2`, the bitstring is `q2`, `q1`, `q0`. So the state vector is still `[00, 01, 10, 11]` from this perspective. We can see this in the CX gate.\n",
