    "# Lab 4: Simulating a single qubit system\n",
    "In this assignment, you’ll build a small (but real) quantum state simulator in Python while practicing core software engineering skills. You’ll implement a reusable `QubitSystem` interface (using an abstract base class) that supports initializing and inspecting quantum states and applying a handful of standard quantum gates, then create a concrete `SingleQubitSystem` implementation that inherits from it. Along the way, you’ll strengthen your understanding of how quantum states can be represented (bra-ket vs. state vectors), how **object-oriented** design helps you structure and extend code cleanly, and how test-driven development (TDD) can guide you to implement correct behavior incrementally with confidence.\n"

    "# Object-oriented programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a way to organize code around “objects” that bundle **data** (attributes) with **behavior** (methods). A core OOP idea is to define a general blueprint for a family of related things, then create more specific versions by extending that blueprint. This helps you reuse code, keep responsibilities clear, and make it easier to add new features without rewriting existing logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base classes and shared behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "A common pattern is to create a **base class** (sometimes called an interface) that defines what all related objects should be able to do. In the example below, `Polygon` represents “any shape with sides.” Because every polygon has a number of sides, we can implement `print_number_of_sides()` once in `Polygon` and automatically reuse it in every child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract methods and specialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Some behaviors depend on the specific type of polygon. For instance, the formula for area is different for triangles and rectangles, so `calculate_area()` is declared as an abstract method in `Polygon`. That means `Polygon` is promising “every polygon can calculate an area,” but it requires each subclass to provide the actual formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance and `super()`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write a child class, you often still want to run some of the “standard setup” code that the parent class already provides. Python’s `super()` lets you call that parent-class code from inside your child class, instead of copying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in `Triangle`, we call `super().__init__(num_sides=3)` to run the `Polygon` constructor so the triangle is initialized with the correct number of sides. Then we add triangle-specific fields like `base` and `height`.\n"
